	<h1>Transfer Guide | Going from Collin College to UTD</h1>
	<h2>What is This?</h2>
		<p>This is a collection of notes and gathered information from my time as a transfer student going from Collin College to UTD. This guide was written because nothing like it exists at the current time, and had this existed when I transferred it would have made my transition much easier. This guide is specific to someone looking to get a bachelor's degree in computer science however, other engineering majors will share many of the same questions that you can find answers to in this guide.
		</p>
	
	<h2>Who I Am</h2>
		<p>I am, at the time of writing this, a computer science major at UTD in my junior year. I started my college journey in 2016 at Collin College. I am a non-traditional student, and spent 5 years after highschool as an aircraft mechanic before deciding to go to college.
		</p>
	
	<h2>Disclaimer</h2>
		<p>So first a disclaimer: I am going to give advice here that is to the best of my knowledge correct at the date of this guide being written (Spring 2019). However, I'm also just some random dude on the internet so you should absolutely verify anything I say. "Trust but verify" should be your new life motto as you read not only this, but also talk to any advisors or read any other guides as well.
		</p>
		
	<h2>Am I Happy With the Education I Received at Collin?</h2> 
		<p>Overall I have no major complaints with the education I received from Collin, and highly recommend them to anyone looking at an alternative to 4 years at a university. The teachers were excellent and the class size was small and responsive compared to UTD. I have not had any problems with the Math classes I am currently taking, I was able to jump right in to Discrete Math II and Probability and Stats with no surprises. 
		</p>
		
		<p>My only minor complaint would be that I found Collin's Computer Science II(COSC2436) to be lacking some of the things that I was supposed to already know going into UTD's CS3345 Data Structures class. Most everyone who took this class at UTD seems to have already been introduced to BST's, Hash Tables, and have more proficiency with implementing other Data Structures quickly.
		</p>
		
		<p>Overall, I'm happy with my decision to go the community college route as I have zero debt and was able to get some of the transfer scholarships. The only thing I was lacking was some Data Structures knowledge but I was able to pick that up over a few weekends with the help of YouTube and online articles. Other than that I was able to jump right in to my classes at UTD with no problems and no other missing foundational knowledge. 
		</p>

  <h2>General Tips</h2>
		<p>1: If at all possible transfer in during a Fall semester at UTD. This seems to be the usual timeline for not only freshmen starting but transfer students coming in as well. If for nothing else you will be able to apply for more external transfer scholarships this way, for example the "Jack Kent Cooke"  <a href="https://www.jkcf.org/our-scholarships/undergraduate-transfer-scholarship/">transfer scholarship.</a> A lot of these external scholarships are based on you transferring in a Fall semester.
		</p>
		
		<p>2: If you're a slightly older non-traditional student, as I was, here is some financial aid advice. If that's not the case you can skip this point. Make sure you fill out the FAFSA religiously every year, even if you don't think you qualify for anything. The government loves throwing money at non-traditional students over the age of 25 in the form of Pell Grants. Also apply for any of the Collin College foundation scholarships as they are fairly easy to obtain.
		</p>
		
		<p>3: FILL OUT THE COMET CONNECTION PAPER. This should be mandatory for any student that is transferring from Collin to UTD. It provides a number of benefits, but the primary benefit is it locks in your tuition. For example, I signed the comet connection in early 2017, because of this when I start classes at UTD in Spring 2019 I will be paying tuition rates from Fall of 2016. If we do the math on that, I will be saving about $2700 over four semester at UTD. The best part about this whole thing is you only have to print out the form, take it to a Collin advisor and have them initial it, and mail it in. So for the cost of a stamp and a half-hour of your time you can save a significant amount of money. Here's the website where you can print the form. <a href="https://www.utdallas.edu/enroll/transfer/comet-connection/">Link</a>
		</p>
		
		<p>4: Collin has guaranteed transfer scholarships based on your grades at Collin. By maintaining above a 3.75 GPA at Collin you'll automatically get $1500 per full-time semester at UTD. So by working hard now you can net about $6000 over the course of four semesters at UTD. <a href="https://www.utdallas.edu/enroll/transfer/scholarships/">Link</a>
		</p>
		
		<p>5: Join Phi Theta Kappa(PTK). As long as you have been maintaining above a 3.5 GPA you will get emails from PTK asking you to join their organization. It costs about $120. This is another guaranteed scholarship at UTD. By maintaining above a 3.5 GPA you'll automatically get $500 per semester at UTD. So for a $120 investment you'll earn $2000 over four semesters at UTD. <a href="https://www.utdallas.edu/enroll/transfer/scholarships/">Link</a>
		</p>
		
		<p>6: Trust but verify anything you Collin advisors tell you about the classes you need to take and what will/won't transfer to UTD. Collin advisors are a great resource and everyone of the ones Iâ€™ve dealt with has been great. But keep in mind they work for Collin not UTD. You need to touch base with UTD at least once a year, or even better once a semester while at Collin to make sure you only take classes that will transfer and are following the UTD requirements for your degree program. Here's the website where you can book an advising appointment or get the email of your advisor, just click on the Genbook button in the following link. <a href="https://engineering.utdallas.edu/academics/undergraduate-majors/undergrad-advising/">Link</a> Note: You CAN book an appointment without being a current UTD student.
		</p>
		
		<p>7: UTD advisors don't know anything. This may be specific to my computer science major as that department is bursting at the seems, but confirm anything your UTD advisor tells you. Have email proof or record the audio of when you talk to them in person. I have in the past three years never seen the same advisor twice and have been told multiple different answers to question I have as a transfer student. Whether our not it would actually help you I don't know, but at least being able to pull out old emails when they tell something different next time has worked for me.
		</p>
		
	<h2>I Want to Take as Many Classes as Possible at Collin to Save Money. What Do I Need To Know?</h2>
		<p>Excellent choice, this will save you the most amount of money. You will also not be getting any less of an education. Everyone has to take the same core classes and by taking them at Collin you get one-on-one interaction with the professor, a class size limited to about 30 students, and a significantly cheaper cost.
		</p>
		
		<p>All in all you can take 64 fully transferable credit hours at Collin, this will leave you just 60 junior and senior level classes to complete at UTD. The following table contains the list of classes I took at Collin that transferred in with no problem as well as some alternatives.

		<p>Now if we were to add all these hours up we would actually see 66 credit hours versus the 64 I told you would transfer in. This is because of a slight discrepancy in free elective hours where we would either be one hour short or two hours over. So even though we only transfer 64 hours towards the degree we have to take the 66 total hours to get this to work.
		</p>
		
		<p>A few things to note in this section. Collin's COSC2436 is one hour higher than UTD's, this is fine and there will be no problems with it during transfer. Also Collin's MATH2318 is one hour less than UTD's MATH2418, this is fine and they will actually shift over one credit hour from your science elective to fill in this discrepancy as Collin's science electives are one hour higher than UTD's. If you have any problem getting an advisor to approve this let me know and I can send you a copy of an email from UTD's advising department approving this hour shift.
		</p>
		
		<p>There are also a few classes you may need to take at Collin that UTD considers remedial classes. This means that these classes will transfer but will not be put towards you degree. These classes include the following.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			<table style="width:50%">

		<p>For this next section I will assume you have taken all the possible 64 credit hours at Collin, and are ready to transfer in to UTD. At this point you will have 60 credit hours you still need to take to achieve the 124 hours required for the major. The following table shows a degree path that will allow you to complete your degree in four semesters while being in accordance with pre-requisite and co-requisite guideline for these classes according to the <a href="https://engineering.utdallas.edu/files/4YEAR-CS-2018.pdf">UTD flowchart</a>. This is a very specific order, and if you intend to deviate from it I strongly suggest you map everything out and make sure you have a good plan. Some of the last two semester's classes can be switched between each other as needed, just verify on the <a href="https://engineering.utdallas.edu/files/4YEAR-CS-2018.pdf">UTD flowchart</a> to make sure you're switching appropriate ones.

		<p>So, coupling these 60 hours with the 64 transferred in from Collin you will now have the 124 hours necessary  for the bachelor's of science in computer science.
		</p>
			
	<h2>I Want to Dual Enroll for a Semester to Save Money. What Do I Need To Know?</h2>
		<p>Excellent question, this has both a short answer and a long answer depending on your situation.
		</p>
		
		<p>There are two possible categories you fit into. 1: You are not receiving any financial aid and are paying for school out of pocket, and are not concerned with financial aid during this "dual enrollment" semester. 2: You are receiving financial aid now, and plan on receiving financial aid at UTD.
		</p>
		
		<p>Case 1 answer to your question: Absolutely, there are no downfalls that I am aware of to doing this, and while I did not do this personally I know of at least half a dozen people that did with no problems. Sometimes there are minor inconveniences like having to pay for parking at UTD even though your only attending for one class, spring break schedules that are different, or having to use two different online portals for schoolwork(i.e. Canvas and Blackboard). But like I said these are fairly minor inconveniences at best.
		</p>
		
		<p>Case 2 answer to your question: This is where it gets tricky. Technically you would be attending two schools and be a "part-time" student at both.("part-time" usually meaning taking less than 12 credit hours, "full-time" usually meaning taking 12 or more credit hours) This means that financial aid is kind of a mess. 
		</p>
		
		<p>For example: lets say you take 3 hours at UTD and 9 hours at Collin. Now you and I both know you are taking 12 credit hours and should be considered a "full-time" student and get "full-time" student" financial aid. However, each school simply views you as a "part-time" student and they do not consider the bigger picture. This can mean losing out on "full-time" financial aid and only qualifying for "part-time" financial aid. This means in some circumstances you can actually lose money by attending two schools "part-time". 
		</p>
		
		<p>For example: Lets say that Collin and Government aid pays you $2000 per semester as a "full-time" student, but will only pay you $500 as a "part-time" student. Let's also say that UTD and Government will pay you $4000 per semester as a "full-time" student, but will only pay you $750 as a "part-time" student. Now lets say cost of Collin is $150 per credit hour and cost of UTD is $500 per credit hour. We now have three cases to look at, lets assume you take 14 credit hours in the following example:
		</p>
		
		<p>
			<table style="width:50%">
				<tr>
					<th>Full time at Collin</th>
					<th>Half Collin-Half UTD</th> 
					<th>Full time UTD</th>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Total Cost: $2100</td>
					<td>Total Cost: $4550</td>
					<td>Total Cost: $7000</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Total Aid: $2000</td>
					<td>Total Aid: $1250</td>
					<td>Total Aid: $4000</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Net Cost: $100</td>
					<td>Net Cost: $3300</td>
					<td>Net Cost: $3000</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		</p>
		
		<p>So in this example, even though "dual-enrollment" is cheaper than "full-time" at UTD, the amount of scholarship money you miss out on because you're a "part-time" student outweighs the original cost savings and you end with a net loss.
		</p>
		
		<p>Now this is a fake example, but when I ran the numbers a few years ago when I was considering "dual-enrollment" at 2 colleges, the results were usually pretty similar to the above many times even worse. 
		</p>
		
		<p>So having said all that, is there anyway around being labelled as "part-time" when you're taking a "full-time" amount of hours? Kind of...You can look into something called a "Consortium Agreement" this essentially allows both schools to recognize you're a full-time student. I did not know about this back when I was considering "dual-enrollment" so you will need to do some Googling as well as have some in-depth conversations with the financial aid departments at UTD and Collin to make sure this would work. Here are some articles that describe this kind of Consortium Agreement. <a href="https://joshuahernandezonline.wordpress.com/2010/04/08/attending-two-colleges-simultaneously-while-on-financial-aid/">Link1</a> <a href="https://www.pcc.edu/enroll/paying-for-college/financial-aid/review-award/co-enrollment.html">Link2</a>
